DVW.MCP.MCP25AA1024 is a class for Microsoft .NET Micro Framework 4.1 and 4.2
for communicating with Microchip 25AA1024 SPI 1Mbit (128K bytes) EEPROM

It requires Microsoft .NET Micro Framework 4.1 and a target board such as FEZ Panda II or Netduino and addition of a Microchip 25AA1024 chip.

The goal of this project is for data to be saved/retrieved from the EEPROM using SPI.

The development environment supported is Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 using C#.  The Express Edition should also work, but has not been tested by this developer.

A test project is located in the test folder.
